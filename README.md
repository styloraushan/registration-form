This is a Simple User Registration & Login systems app done with Node.js Framework using MongoDB(Atlas) as the data store, Express as the routing system, Body-parser as the parser for webpage, Express-session used to track the user's session and of course Mongoose to make interacting with Mongo from Node easy.
